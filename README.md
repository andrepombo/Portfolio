### About me
  
Full‑stack developer from Brazil. I design, build, and ship production‑grade apps end‑to‑end—from backend architecture and frontend UX to CI/CD and cloud infrastructure.
 
Originally trained as an Environmental Engineer, I transitioned into software and now deliver complete solutions: APIs, web apps, containerized services, and automated deployments.
